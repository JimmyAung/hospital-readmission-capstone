# hospital-readmission-capstone

**TL;DR:** Threshold-tuned Random Forest optimized for **Recall ≈ 98%** (thr ≈ 0.373). One-page Power BI shows KPIs, confusion matrix, probability distribution, and top features.

Recall-first ML project predicting 30-day hospital readmissions. Includes EDA &amp; model notebooks (Logistic Regression &amp; Random Forest with threshold tuning), a Power BI dashboard, and reproducibility notes. Raw data excluded; see /data/README.md for access instructions.

# Hospital Readmission Prediction (Capstone)

Predicting 30-day hospital readmissions from structured EHR-like tabular data.  
Focus: **high recall** to catch as many potential readmissions as possible, with model transparency and an Ops-friendly Power BI view.

![Power BI dashboard showing KPIs, probability distribution and top features](reports/PowerBI_dashboard.png)
**Results at a glance**
- Tuned threshold to prioritize **Recall ≈ 0.98** (catch as many readmissions as possible)
- **F1 ≈ 0.64**, **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.65**
- Top drivers: `n_inpatient`, `n_emergency`, `n_medications`, `n_lab_procedures`, `time_in_hospital`

## 🧭 Project Summary
- Built a recall-first ML pipeline (EDA → feature engineering → model training/validation).
- Compared baseline Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest and tuned threshold to prioritize **Recall ≈ 0.98** at **thr ≈ 0.373**  
  (trade-offs: **F1 ≈ 0.64**, **Accuracy ≈ 0.49**, **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.65**).
- Delivered a one-page **Power BI** dashboard for non-technical stakeholders (confusion matrix, KPIs, feature importance).

## 🧪 Data
- Source: Kaggle — **Hospital Readmissions**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions
  Kaggle page: **(add link here)**  
- To reproduce:
  1. Download the dataset locally.
  2. Place raw CSV/XLSX files under `notebooks/data/` (keep file names used in the notebooks).
- This public repo excludes raw data to keep the repository light and respect data distribution terms.

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
Tested on **Python 3.11** and **Power BI Desktop (Nov 2024+)**.
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Power BI**: single-page ops dashboard (.pbix)  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks (no re-run required to read; code and outputs are preserved)

---

## 🔍 Modeling Approach (short)
- Baselines: Dummy & Logistic Regression  
- Tree-based: Random Forest (feature importance for explainability)  
- Class imbalance handled via threshold tuning to favor **Recall**.  
- Key features (top importance): *n_inpatient, n_emergency, n_medications, n_lab_procedures, time_in_hospital*, etc.
