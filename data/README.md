# Data Folder

This repository does **not** ship raw data.

**How to get the dataset**
- Source: *Kaggle – “Hospital Readmissions”* (add the exact link you used).
- Download locally and place input files under `notebooks/data/` (keep the same filenames used in the notebooks).

> Reason: keep the repo light and respect data sharing terms.
